Breaking down the Project 
    1. Create a Carrot/Rabbit/Wolf module with supervisors.
    2. Spike into Best graphics

Questions?
1. Whats the user interface?
    A. User starts the app and initializes the number of carrot/rabbit/wolf patches.
    We show the world (the board) and the simulation just start from there.
